  <p class="intro">Just because we're a relatively new business, that doesn't mean we haven't still worked on some amazing projects and websites.</p>
  <h2>Recent Web Design &amp; Development Projects</h2>
  <p>Our design and development team has worked with many companies in designing and developing advanced websites and systems.</p>
  <p>The tasks performed have ranged from simple web design to entire system development, on both the internal and external facing sides of the websites.  We take pride in what we do, and we strive to produce the best results for you, your business and your customers.</p>

  <h2>Recent Social Media Development Projects</h2>
  <p>In July 2010 our development team completed a system for The Network Group's NetworkVideo brand which involved developing a batch facebook updater to broadcast marketing messages to many facebook accounts simultaniously.</p>
  <p>Prior to the systems implementation there was an excessive amount of time being consumed to update the 100+ facebook accounts.  We developed and implemented a system that turned a day's work in to just a few minutes.</p>
  <p>The NetworkGroup now knows the power of our social application development, maybe you should find out.</p>
